    <h1>Terms and Conditions for Service Credits</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 10/21/2024</strong></p>

    <p>These Terms and Conditions govern the purchase and use of service credits provided by Ahadi Software Africa (hereinafter referred to as "the Company"). By purchasing service credits, you agree to these terms in full. If you do not agree with these terms, do not purchase service credits.</p>

    <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Credits</strong>: A unit of measure that represents the value of services provided by Ahadi Software Africa. Service credits can be used for various services offered by the Company.</li>
        <li><strong>Rollover Credits</strong>: Unused service credits that can be carried over to the next billing cycle, subject to the conditions outlined in these Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Top-Up</strong>: The requirement for clients to purchase additional service credits to reach a mandatory minimum amount.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Service Credit Purchase</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clients can purchase service credits in advance for a minimum period of six months.</li>
        <li>The number of service credits required will be determined based on estimated services needed during the six-month period.</li>
        <li>All purchases must be made upfront, and no refunds will be issued for unused service credits.</li>
        <p>Clients are required to purchase a minimum of 3,600 service credits at a time. This minimum purchase ensures clients have sufficient credits to cover a range of services over several months, promoting a consistent and effective working relationship with Ahadi Software Africa.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Rollover Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Clients may roll over unused service credits at the end of the six-month period.</li>
        <li>Rollover credits will be valid for the subsequent billing cycle but must be topped up to maintain a minimum balance of service credits equivalent to six months’ worth of credits.</li>
        <li>If a client does not reach the mandatory minimum by the end of the rollover period, the unused credits will expire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Top-Up Requirement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To maintain access to services, clients must top up their service credits to ensure a minimum balance equal to six months’ worth of service credits before the start of the new billing period.</li>
        <li>The top-up amount will be based on the current pricing structure set by Ahadi Software Africa.</li>
        <li>Clients will be notified of their remaining service credits and the top-up requirement 30 days before the end of the billing cycle.</li>
    </ul>
